## Factorial

## Find the Longest Word in a String
    - Convert string to array
    - Apply sort() to the new array
    
    - **NOTE:**
        - sort modifies the original array
        - sort alone works only on strings
        - to make sort work on numbers, supply a helper function
            - function (a, b) {return b - a }
